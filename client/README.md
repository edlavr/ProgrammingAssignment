# Programming Summative Assessment 2

Web site documentation

## Getting Started

This is user's guide to Dumb Luck - a website where you can prove that you are amongst the luckiest people on Earth. Briefly, this website just gives you a random number between 1 and 7,000,000,000 (Earth population)

When first entering the website you are ~~struck with amazement~~ located at the only page this website has - new information is uploading using AJAX

You are being kindly asked to login/register using the from by Firebase (was allowed) which log you in to using your email address or Google or Facebook, up to you.

Closer to the bottom of the page there is a table mocking data of other users being the luckiest they can be. Right now there are 14 people, but you can only see 10 on load, the other 4 (or more after you enter the table too) are being loaded using AJAX and available via nice blue button, which dissappears after you have all people displayed. The other button refreshes the table without actually refreshing the page - also done using AJAX. Can't wait to join the Hall of Fame? Log in now!

After you log in, a new form appears which allows you to spread the word of love in this neat table. Oh, and don't worry about your name, it loads straight from your login data, as well as a picture of you if you are using Facebook or Google

After pressing the 'Try your luck button', it dissappears, not allowing multiple entries. Works even after refreshing the browser!

There is also another button that appears when you log in - a log out button (obvious). It is located in the nav bar. Nav bar and the whole website is responsive to different viewport sizes. Nav bar is collapsible - turns into hamburger (yum!). You can check smartphone compatability using Chrome: Right click on webpage -> Inspect -> Ctrl(Command on Mac)+Shift+M -> Click on Responsive -> choose a device

Last but not least - search. If you desperately need to find someone from this table, just enter their name and click on search and you will see all the information about the person you were searching for.


That should be it, ~~hit dat like and subscribe button~~ I hope you had a good experience with the website and this README!
